### Hedging Analysis using Jupyter Notebook

You are asked to maintain a pair trade of TQQQ long and QLD short so that over a period of 3 months the net profit is zero. You are constrained to the following:

Initial TQQQ long position has $1 million market value.
You can only rebalance the pair trade by trading QLD. That is, leave the TQQQ long position intact.
For rebalancing trade, you can only perform it at opening and/or closing auctions. That is, you can trade at most twice a day, and the price you get is either the open price or close price.
 
Present a quantitative analysis of different rebalancing strategies and make a recommendation.

You can get the open and close price data from Yahoo Finance.



### Monte Carlo Simulation (Jupyter Notebook)

Write a Monte Carlo simulation to answer the question below.

You’re about to board a train from London to Newcastle. You want to know if it’s raining, so you call your three friends who live in Newcastle. Each friend has a 2/3 chance of telling you the truth and a 1/3 chance of telling you a lie. All three friends tell you that, yes, it’s raining in Newcastle. What is the probability that it is, in fact, raining in Newcastle?
