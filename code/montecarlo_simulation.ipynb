    "You’re about to board a train from London to Newcastle. You want to know if it’s raining, so you call your three friends who live in Newcastle. Each friend has a 2/3 chance of telling you the truth and a 1/3 chance of telling you a lie. All three friends tell you that, yes, it’s raining in Newcastle. What is the probability that it is, in fact, raining in Newcastle?\n",
    "\n",
    "First of all, we need to understand that this analysis could be solved using a closed-form from a frequentist point of view.\n",

    "$$ \\text{Probability of rain} = 1 - \\text{Probability of not rain}$$\n",
