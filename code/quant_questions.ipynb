    "### 1. In a country in which people only want girls, every family continues to have children until they have a girl. If they have a boy, they have another child. If they have a girl, they stop. What is the proportion of boys to girls in the country?\n",
    "\n",
    "This problem can be solved using a negative binomial approach since we are looking that each new birth could be seen as a Bernoulli trial (2 possible outcomes, iid, and no time-changing probabilities).\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a sequence of independent Bernoulli trials (a birth), with 2 possible outcomes (girl or boy), each outcome has a probability of success $p$ (girl) and faiure $1-p$ (boy), we observe this sequence until a determined number of successes occurs (1 girl), so the number of failures (# of boys) follows the Negative Binomial distribution. In this case, let's assume that $p = 1 - p = 0.5$ the probability of having a girl or a boy.\n",

    "$$\\text{\\# of boys} \\sim BN(r, p) = BN(1, 0.5)$$\n",

    "The expected value of a Negative Binomial distribution looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$E[\\text{\\# of boys}] = E[BN(r, p)] = \\dfrac{r * (1 - p)}{p} = \\dfrac{1 * (1 - 0.5)}{0.5} = 1$$\n",
    "\n",
    "So given a success (1 girl), the expected value of number of boys is 1, which leads to a 1:1 ratio.\n",

    "### 2. How would you explain a linear regression to a business executive?\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a technique to predict some variables, given some information that comes from another variable. For instance, let's take a look at a prediction of a house price. Intuitively, you can think that if a house is bigger, with a larger number of beds and a bigger area, the price would be higher as well. That is the kind of question that a linear regression allows us to answer.\n",

    "### 3. What’s the meaning of p-value?\n",
    "\n",
    "Is the probability of observing a certain behavior of data, assuming that behavior is true. For example, I would like to know how probable the mean of a variable is equal to zero, assuming it is actually zero, if that probability is high, we do not have evidence to say that the mean is not zero, but if that value is low, we could say 2 things, we are very lucky to obtain some extreme event/mean value or the mean of that variable simply is not zero.\n",

Each friend has a 2/3 chance of telling you the truth and a 1/3 chance of telling you a lie. All three friends tell you that, yes, it’s raining in Newcastle. What is the probability that it is, in fact, raining in Newcastle?\n",

    "### 6. Why is it more important to correlate alpha return (vs market index) than total return?\n",
    "\n",
    "If we compute the correlation between the alpha of a portfolio (excess of return respect the expected return) respect the market, we are getting information if our excess of return is related to some degree of the market performance. If we are looking to generate profit no matter if market goes up or down, we would like to see not just a positive alpha, but a low correlation with respect to the market. If we run the same calculation with the total return, we can not make the previous conclusions. Just to clarify, this alpha return is Jensen's alpha, which graphically could be seen as this\n",

    "     align=\"center\"\n",
    "     width=\"500\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "that could be estimated as this\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{alpha}_{jensen} = R_{i} - R_{rf} - \\beta_{i,Market} * (R_{M} - R_{rf})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of CAPM, calculating alpha requires the following inputs:\n",
    "\n",
    "$R_{i}$: the realized return (on the portfolio),\n",
    "\n",
    "$R_M$: the market return,\n",
    "\n",
    "$R_{rf}$: the risk-free rate of return, and\n",
    "\n",
    "${\\displaystyle \\beta _{i,Market}}$: the beta of the portfolio.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. Does high correlation mean high beta? Does low correlation mean low beta?\n",
    "\n",
    "Not necessarily, beta is related not just to the direction of the movement of certain assets respecting the market, but the magnitude of that movement respecting the market, and correlation only gives me information about the direction of the movement.\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of estimation, we could define a relationship between correlation and beta like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\beta = \\dfrac{Cov(R_{port}, R_{Market})}{\\sigma(R_{Market}^{2})}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "and \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\rho(R_{port}, R_{Market}) = \\dfrac{Cov(R_{port}, R_{Market})}{\\sigma(R_{Port}) * \\sigma(R_{Market})} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "so\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ Cov(R_{port}, R_{Market}) = \\rho(R_{port}, R_{Market}) * \\sigma(R_{Port}) * \\sigma(R_{Market}) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we got\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\beta = \\dfrac{ \\rho(R_{port}, R_{Market}) * \\sigma(R_{Port}) * \\sigma(R_{Market}) }{\\sigma(R_{Market}^{2})} = \\dfrac{ \\rho(R_{port}, R_{Market}) * \\sigma(R_{Port}) }{\\sigma(R_{Market})}  =  \\dfrac{ \\rho * \\sigma(R_{Port}) }{\\sigma(R_{Market})} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Because both standard deviations are necessarily positive, beta, and the correlation will have the same sign/direction, but if we could have a highly correlated asset respect market but if its volatility is low, the beta will be low, and vice versa, we could have a not that high correlated asset but an extremely volatile one (more than market), we could have a larger beta.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. What’s an asset example that has zero beta vs S&P 500 index?\n",
    "\n",
    "By beta's definition, we only will got a zero beta respect S&P 500 index if its correlation respect SP is zero or its standard deviation is zero, or if this covariance respect SP is zero, that implies that its return is the same as the expected return, again, no risk, a free risk asset, something that no matter what, always will return the same (zero, positive or negative return). Based on that, I can only imagine an asset whose value is questionable, like air, something that grants me a zero return.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 9. If you were told that a stock’s beta = 2 and R^2 = 0.00001, would you use the beta? Why or why not? What else would you check to support your conclusion?\n",
    "\n",
    "I will try to run some analysis before using it.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a linear regression with an intercept and a single explanatory variable (basically the estimation of CAPM), we could prove that the squared Pearson correlation coefficient is equal to R^2, so in this case, if we got R^2= 0.00001, that will mean $\\rho = \\sqrt{0.00001} \\approx +/- 0.003$ but with a positive beta, then $\\rho = \\sqrt{0.00001} \\approx  0.003$\n",
    "\n",
    "With that in mind, we could say that if beta = 2, then the volatility of the market is too low or the asset's volatility is too high. If we got the intuition and estimation that rejects some of the previous conclusions, then we need to run some other analysis, since that beta could be poorly estimated. One possibility is checking for anomaly observations on the asset returns, since beta is related to the volatility of the market and the asset, having this problem might affect the estimations. Another test that we could run is a Heteroscedasticity test (e.g. Breuge-Pagan or White tests), since we could be capturing the tendency/slope correctly (beta) but because some increasing dispersion returns of the asset given an increase of market return, we could have a low R^2.\n",

    "### 10. What’s the pros and cons of using log return instead of linear return?\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few cons, like:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $\\text{ln(1+Ret)}$ is Normal Distribution, and that is a cool feature to use on some stochastic models (e.g. GMB, Hull-White IR model, etc).\n",
    "- The way that we can create a cumulative return, is by simply adding the returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, there are some cons, mainly in optimization processes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- With this transformation $\\text{ln(1+Ret)}$, we are making some assumptions over the return distribution, that in general is not true (see [Rama Cont (2001) to see heavy tails and non gaussian behaviours](http://rama.cont.perso.math.cnrs.fr/pdf/empirical.pdf))\n",
    "- According to [Attilio Meucci (2010)](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1548162) and [Attilio Meucci (2010)](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1586656) we could easily fall on estimating a forecasted var-covar matrix that will increase linearly with time, producing some misallocations.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 11.  If total return = alpha return + beta return, for multi-period performance, what’s wrong with compounding alpha returns?\n",
    "\n",
    "You are letting out of the analysis the behavior of the market. If we only see the alpha return, I could consistently beat the market (50pbs of alpha) but not necessarily create value for the investment (profit) (market return of -500pbs leading to -450pbs of total return). So if I compound only alpha, I could be rewarding the PM when he/she could actually lose money from a global perspective.\n",

    "# Data Interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "### 12. Why do two series have high correlation but totally different compounded returns?\n",
    "\n",
    "That is because correlation only gives me information about the consistency of the movement's direction for both assets, not necessarily on the magnitude of those movements. On the other hand, with correlation, we do not have information about the mean/expected return of each asset. To give more clarification about this, I just run some simulations based on Cholesky's decomposition of var-covar matrix and we obtain this (see calculations on simulation_of_correlated_assets.ipynb notebook):\n",

    "### 13.  A company selling a competitor to Microsoft Office is testing their marketing by sending out two different sets of emails. One set contains business related content, and one contains consumer related content. We are interested in how each campaign performed; did one do better at getting people to click-through? Below is a selection of graphs on the two email campaigns. The bottom two graphs have the same data as the top two, only bucketed by the amount the customer has spent with the company the year before the emails were sent. Which campaign did better?\n",

For some reason, there is an unbalance proportion of the number of emails sent by the spend bucket, which is why from an aggregated point of view, customers did better than business ones (the 12% click-rate is more weighted than 19%, and 29% click-rates), but the business ones respond better to this campaign, having a higher click-rate."
